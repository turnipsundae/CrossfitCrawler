Well hey there! How‚Äôd ya make out yesterday? I saw a bunch of As Rx‚Äôd postings yesterday. What‚Äôs that? As Rx‚Äôd? That means you did the WOD exactly as it was written with no substitutions and no scaling. I also saw a bunch of folks who obviously took the time to look at the FAQ over there on the upper left side of the CrossFit.com front page. There it was, as plain as day, a sub for L-PU: tuck PU, a PU with your knees tucked up under your butt. Remember, I told you that these posts can be completely ignored with a bit of exploration of the website and Instagram!

Anywho, here you are, back for another day! What does Coach have on tap for you today? Oh‚Ä¶wait‚Ä¶you might not know who Coach is. Well, Coach is this guy named Greg Glassman, a UCLA math major who decided he would revolutionize the fitness and health industries instead of doing something more normal like, maybe solve Fermat‚Äôs Theorem or something like that. Coach became a personal trainer the likes of which had never been seen before, got himself kicked out of a couple dozen gyms, and the rest is history. Do yourself a favor and click on ‚ÄúWhat is Fitness‚Äù, also over there on the left side of the page, for the single most interesting thing ever written about fitness. Seriously.

Whatta we have today, then? I‚Äôm detecting a bit of a pattern here (more on that in a minute). Another task-specific WOD. Row 1000 Meters followed by 5 rounds of the couplet 20 Hip Extensions (HE)/16 GHD Sit-ups (SU), and then row another 1000Meters. Get your heart rate up, fry your core, and then hold on to your heart and lungs for dear life. Yep, pretty much CrossFit right there. Let‚Äôs break it down.

Row 1000M. Any time you see ‚ÄúRow‚Äù in CrossFit it means row on a Concept 2 (C2) rowing machine. Period. Any kind of rower can be used if it can record meters or occasionally calories, but when Coach asks for a row he is visualizing you suffering on a C2. I‚Äôm not kidding; no one‚Äôs gonna be able to answer questions about any other kind of rower.

Sit in the seat, strap your feet in, set the damper (the lever on the right side of that big round thing sticking out in front of you) on 4 or 5, grab the handle and start to row. This is a classic core-to-extremity, full-body exercise. Drive your legs, then extend your back, then and only then pull with your arms = the stroke. Push your arms out, bend your back forward, and then bend your legs = the catch. The standard sub is a Sumo Deadlift High Pull with an empty 45lb. bar (35 for women), with one rep = 10M (look for a video in ‚ÄúExercises and Demos‚Äù). You can sub running (800M) or biking (2 miles), or if you live in Perth swimming (200M).

20 Hip Extensions (HE). In CrossFit nomenclature this means doing what people usually think of as a Back Extension without ever bending your back. You maintain a straight lumbar spine (maintain your lordotic curve) during each rep. You can use a GHD machine, a Roman Chair, or other similar extension apparatus. Subs would be a Good Morning, Superman, or extension while lying on an exercise ball. Total of 100 if you do ‚Äòem all.

16 GHD Sit-Ups (SU). This is an advanced exercise, suitable and safe for only experienced athletes who train on a GHD (Glute-Ham Developer) regularly and routinely. Remember, I‚Äôm writing to you, Mr. or Ms. NewbieYou, and you aren‚Äôt and you don‚Äôt. Let me be perfectly clear: DO NOT DO THESE ON A GHD. For those of you with some CF under your belt who don‚Äôt routinely do these here‚Äôs a bit of friendly advice for you, too: DO NOT DO THESE ON A GHD. If you do don‚Äôt ask me to come to the ER to explain why your nether regions have swollen to the size of a grapefruit. Do 16 regular SU, maybe using an Abmat if you wish. Total of 80.

How much of this should you do? If you are new to CrossFit but not new to fitness go ahead and do all of the reps and both rows, with the caveats noted. New to both CF and fitness, or long estranged from the physical aspects of being a human being? Cut everything in half (500M rows, 10 BE, 8 SU). Oh yeah‚Ä¶the pattern? Two days in a row where you engage your core, static yesterday (L-PU) and dynamic today (HE, SU).

Row, row, row your core in 3-2-1‚Ä¶Go.

As rx'd. Took about 20 minutes. Too hard to keep track of the time for each descent. Definitely able to lower much more slowly from pull-up. For HS, did first 10 reps against a wall (trying not to use it), lowered feet first, then to straddle, then down. Did last 10 reps freestanding, and tried to come down in straddle.

Did you rest yesterday? Really? I mean, really rest? I sure hope so. Did you look at what's up there for today's WOD?! That's some heavy sh...shtuff right there.

CrossFit is a strength and conditioning program. If you do CrossFit right out of the box here on the Main Page you will, indeed, get stronger. Will you become as strong as you possibly can, achieve you absolute maximum of maxes? Nah. Of course not. In order to do that you would have to give up all hope of ever having work capacity across broad time and modal domains; you'd just be strong. However, the fact remains that if you do CrossFit you will not only increase your speed, power, and cardiovascular endurance, you will also get stronger. WODs like today's are how we do that.

It's a bit tricky to advise folks on a WOD like this. Are you an experienced power lifter? Have you ever done a deadlift before? How about weightlifting? Do you have experience with the weightlifting exercise the clean? Even if you have some experience with either or both of these exercises it would still be important to have some sense of whether or not you can (or should) be doing a max lift.

Let's start out with this simple, unassailable and incontrovertible fact: if you have never done a deadlift or a clean today is NOT the day to do either a max deadlift or 36 cleans, let alone 36 cleans for time. If this is the case you need to take a big ol' humble pill and make today a learning experience. Find a coach wherever you are working out and ask them to teach you how to deadlift and do a clean. Pay them if necessary. Heck, make them take your money. We do all kinds of deadlifts and cleans. Don't ruin your CrossFit career by blowing a disc out your ass because it says "max deadlift" up there.

Alright, now that we have that out of the way, let's talk about how to approach this if you are a beginner CrossFitter with some lifting experience (or if you are still relatively newish here). The deadlift is the simplest and most useful lift there could be. Pick it up and then put it down. No grunting alarms or concerns about banging your weights, this is CrossFit. Fill an Olympic bar with rubberized weights and then pick it up. In competition (like our upcoming CrossFit Open) you would do a traditional DL with your hands outside your legs. Some, like me, do a sumo stance DL with your legs wide and hands inside (my form is better, and therefore safer). For the WOD no one cares but you. Keep adding weight until gravity wins.

A clean in the simplest terms means picking up a barbell and lifting it until it rests on the front of your shoulders in the "rack" position and standing up. At some point this month I will be able to make really tasteless jokes about "racks" but I'm struggling to find one so I'm gonna let it go today. By convention, if you only see "clean" above that means you are to "catch" the weight in the bottom of a front squat and then stand up to complete the movement. For realsies, if'n you know what yer about, you know that a full "squat clean" will get you a bigger number on a max, but by silent affirmation (at least for Newbies) you should feel free to do a power clean (catch the weight in a quarter squat) if that's more comfortable. Everyone, Newbie or otherwise, should know that "As Rx'd" according to the FAQ is a full (squat) clean.

How's that percentage stack up for you? Man, I look at that and I just cringe. My 1 rep max DL is 315, and my 1 rep max clean is 180. Coach wants me to do 36 cleans, and do them pretty fast, at a weight that's awfully damn close to a lift I've done precisely once. Ever. Here's my bid: be smart. If your numbers are like mine pick a weight that is heavy (that's the requested stimulus), but not so heavy that this is essentially 36 single reps. Aim for 5-7 reps before you have to break. The more inexperienced you are the lower the weight. Do the reps, do them well, and accept a long time, or drastically cut the load and try for a quick time.

You're a Rookster. Be safe. Be smart. Get strong in 3-2-1...Go.
bingo,
Thanks for the clarity on what a rx clean is. Given so many interpretations by mainsite users (some fueled by HQ's videos), I wish HQ would just always specify squat versus power cleans.
Deadlift: 315 overhand (went until I just started to feel discomfort in my lower back....injury).

Hey, that was some heavy stuff yesterday, huh? Pretty cool WOD. If my memory serves, that might be the first WOD here on CrossFit.com where we test a weight and then derive our WOD weight from the individual test. That‚Äôs one of the very cool things about this particular version of CrossFit programming: Coach really takes that constantly varied thing to heart. In an interview I described my pre-CF fitness life as ‚Äúbored and lonely‚Äù in the gym. Well, having the cybergym of CrossFit.com cured the lonely part, and believe me, I‚Äôve never been bored doing CrossFit.

Speaking of variance, it looks like we are apparently in a cycle in which we have a concentration on our midline stabilization. Not only that, but we are learning that we can do this without repeating WODs, even if we do repeat exercises. Variance in format, scheme, and volume gives enough of a difference that we will likely forget that we did a row, sit-ups, and back extensions last cycle!

Once again, a task demand WOD in which we are given a finite amount of work and asked to do it as fast as we can. 3 Rounds of the triplet Row 500M/25 GHD Sit-ups/25 Hip Extensions. Did I mention that this is for time? Just before you make that first pull on your C2 hit ‚Äústart‚Äù on a stopwatch‚Ä¶nah, let‚Äôs get real, hit start on the fancy stopwatch app on your iPhone‚Ä¶do 3 rounds and then hit stop. Flop. Create sweat angel. Take a pic. Who knows, maybe some day Dave Castro will follow someone on Instagram and maybe it will be you, and he will post your sweat angel picture.

Pshaw, don‚Äôt be silly. The Dave Castro is as close as you can get to Chuck Norris‚ÄîInstagram follows The Dave Castro.

Row 500M. Just like the other day, take your seat on a C2, put the damper on 4 or 5, and pull like a motherplucker. Hop off and go over to the GHD‚Ä¶just kidding‚Ä¶you‚Äôre still a Newbie. You have no business whatsoever doing your sit-ups on a GHD. Sit your ass on the ground, let your coccyx get intimate with an Abmat, and do your sit-ups on the ground. 25/round. Do ‚Äòem all. Yer goin‚Äô Almost As Rx‚Äôd today, baby! Hop up and get on that GHD (or Roman Chair, or exercise ball) and pump out 25 Hip Extensions (lower back straight with hips anchored). 3 times through and then hit ‚ÄúStop‚Äù on that stopwatch.

YES! Ye-heh-heh-hee-es! You are on day 6 of CrossFit and you did a WOD Almost As Rx‚Äôd! Run around the gym and high five everything with a pulse. Seriously, it‚Äôs that big a deal. Everyone. Even the lady at the desk who looks remarkably similar to the secretary in the original version of The Longest Yard. Her too. Almost Rx‚Äôd baby! Ask her if she grows spiders in there, just like Burt.

‚ÄòCause that‚Äôs just how we roll here. Row, Row, Row your core v2.0 in 3-2-1‚Ä¶Go.

As rx'd, 18:04. 210# for jerks.

Nice example of how CrossFit pushes you. If we could have picked our own weight for jerks, there is no way I would have gone with 210. But in the end it was doable - just required pacing. Got the first 6 unbroken, which actually beats my 5-rep PR. Probably could have gotten 7 or 8...but again, pacing. Had 3 or 4 jerks with questionable lockout. Broke pullups 20-15-10 / 15-12-9 / 15-6-6.

For Smolov, I'm currently in the 2-week Switching Cycle, so before the metcon, I did:

DU killed my score
Inverted Burpees! Woohoohoo! Oh my, my,my. Inverted Burpees yesterday and you came back anyway. Either you‚Äôre hooked or you‚Äôre crooked in the head.

Either way, we all kinda like that about you.

And what do you get for your dedication and devotion? You get a 10K Row. Ten. Thousand. Meter. Row. You read that right. 8:00 and 8 different movements yesterday and today you sit on your keister for around 40:00 doing one single, solitary thing. That, boys and girls, pretty much defines variance when we talk about CrossFit, both in terms of movements (8 different exercises vs. a mono-structural WOD) and time domain (really short and really not).

Welp, we‚Äôve discussed rowing already. Sit on your C2 and strap in. I‚Äôve never rowed more than 5K, and when I go that long I either sit on a pad or a rolled up towel to cushion my skinny, bony ass. Your call on that. There are differences of opinion on how you should set your damper (that lever on the right side of the circle fan thingy in front of the computer) for a longer row. Some folks stick with 4ish for every distance, others switch up and use a slightly higher damper and slower cadence for longer rows. Again, your call. I typically reduce my strokes/minute but leave my damper on 4.

Should you scale this one? Hmmm‚Ä¶tough call, actually. The other day you did the WOD ‚ÄúAlmost As Rx‚Äôd!!‚Äù Here‚Äôs one you can safely do As Rx‚Äôd, for realzees, without hurting yourself, and you get to say you got a WOD As Rx‚Äôd in your very first month of CrossFit. If you don‚Äôt have a rower the sub is NOT, I repeat NOT 1000 Sumo Deadlift High Pulls with a 45# bar. Sorry, that‚Äôs madness. Sub a 6.2 mile run, a 25 mile bike ride, or 2500 meters in the pool.

I‚Äôll probably regret saying this, but it‚Äôs been kinda easy doing these Newbie Chronicles so far, what with Coach giving us a run-through yesterday and now just a row. Man, now we‚Äôll probably get one of those ‚Äúdo math problems while you hang upside down‚Äù type WODs to explain. Guess we‚Äôll see soon enough.

Off you go then. Rowing across your favorite ocean in 3-2-1‚Ä¶Stroke.

And to complete our cycle‚Äôs lesson in variance, after a long slow single-movement WOD in which we spend the entire time using the oxidative (aerobic) energy pathway, today it‚Äôs all fast-twitch, max effort, anaerobic energy pathway strength stuff. Crazy.

If you are like most of us as we begin our CrossFit adventure you‚Äôve been doing lots of reading about CrossFit on the internet. Doubtless you have read that you can‚Äôt get strong doing CrossFit. Nonsense. So here it is. The mother of all strength WODs, the Crossfit Total. An opportunity to both train and test yourself in the strength domain.

It‚Äôs also an opportunity to learn a little more about how this website works. Every single question you might have can be answered by clicking on ‚ÄúCrossFit Total‚Äù above in blue, a link which will bring you to the original article in the CrossFit Journal introducing the CFT. Anything you see in BLUE is a link, and if the WOD is in BLUE it‚Äôs worth clicking. Frankly, this is also a great time for you to open up your relationship with the CrossFit Journal (CFJ). Seriously, I think it‚Äôs pretty much free now, too. Read up on the CFT.

Still here? Seriously, it‚Äôs a great article. Are you sure you wouldn‚Äôt really rather read it from the source?

Really? OK then, here you go.

The CrossFit Total is a very specific test with very specific parameters that will produce a measurement of strength, the CFT. There have been some nuanced changes in the CFT over the years, but by and large it has remained fairly stable. You get three (3) shots at a 1 rep max at, in order: Back Squat, Shoulder Press, and Deadlift. You are allowed to warm-up each lift before you start, but once you declare your start you get only 3 tries at each lift. You may not go backwards in weight if you miss, so strategy is important both in choosing your starting weight and in planning your increments. For a pure CFT no aids are allowed. No gloves, straps, belts, wraps, or special lifting garb (more below).

The Back Squat is the same squat you did 150 (or 100, or 75, or‚Ä¶) in ‚ÄúCindy‚Äù except this time we are going to put weight on a bar. From a squat rack place the bar on your traps (or across the scapulae if you choose a low bar). Set your hips (reach back with your butt), press your knees out on the way down and up, and squat into your heels to a depth where the crease of your hip goes below your knees. If necessary, bail on the lift by dropping the weight BACKWARDS, in back of you.

A Shoulder Press begins with the loaded bar taken from the rack and held in the ‚Äúfront rack‚Äù position across your clavicle/upper pecs and anterior deltoids. Without using any hip or leg movement press the bar straight up, locking your elbows and finishing the movement with some part of your ear visible in front of your elbows.

For the CFT a very specific Deadlift is required, the standard DL. Stand with feet ~shoulder width apart, hands hanging just outside the knee. Bend your knees and your back, maintaining the lordotic curve, (base of your back) and lift the bar from the ground. A completed lift has you standing straight up with your shoulders behind the bar, followed by replacing the bar on the ground without letting go (dropping the bar = no lift in the CFT).

How about gear? Here‚Äôs the thing: if you use gear of any sort you didn‚Äôt do it As Rx‚Äôd. FWIW I wear gloves for the Deadlift because if I rip my hand I can‚Äôt work, and the quality of Mrs. bingo‚Äôs diet depends on the health of my hands. Likewise a lifting belt--I wear one now whenever I get up in the X-Rep Max range for DL and Squats of any sort. Wraps? I don‚Äôt use them. Straps? Here‚Äôs where I think you have to draw the line. Everything I‚Äôve mentioned thus far is safety related, or at least aimed at injury prevention. Straps allow you to lift something that your body, specifically in this instance your grip strength, canna handle on its own. No straps.

That, dear Newboids, is the CrossFit Total. Should you go ahead and do the CFT? You know, pick up some heavy sh!t and get some benchmarks in the books? Well, it depends. Have you done heavy lifting in the past? Is your form good, especially on the Squat and the Deadlift? No, or no? There‚Äôs your answer. You need to dial in your form before you even THINK about doing a 1 rep max anything. Technique, then consistency, then and only then intensity. Maxing out is a form of intensity, and before you take a run at the CFT you must consistently do the exercises with consistently good technique. Consider using today as a skill day and working on your technique in these classic strength lifts.

‚ÄúBut, but, but‚Ä¶but bingo, I wanna pick up heavy stuff too!‚Äù OK, I‚Äôll make you a deal. If you can find someone you know who knows what he/she is doing, and if you promise to listen to them, and if you both promise that your last lift is not necessarily the one where you lift the heaviest but the one where you have the first, tiny form break, then I‚Äôm OK with you lifting some heavy sh!t, too.

For the rest of you, it‚Äôs time to pick things up and put them doooowwwwnnnn. May I present for your testing pleasure, the CrossFit Total! 3-2-1‚Ä¶GO.

45 second PR from last Dumb Fran. Managed to stay unbroken on all. First time getting the pull-ups unbroken on any version of Fran, and the forearms were absolutely smoked after. Splits 0:42 / 1:16 / ? / 2:42 / 3:05 / 3:23. Round of 21 was mostly adrenaline, though the pull-ups were rough. Round of 15 was the hardest, as usual - thrusters slowed way down. Just trying to end the pain in the round of 9. This had me on the ground for awhile afterward - lungs mostly, but also legs and some strange goings-on in the abdominal region. Gotta love Fran.

Man, I guess we can say that Coach has decided that we haven't paid enough attention to our midline stability. Once again, you ignore a posted video of Coach talking about a particular exercise or piece of equipment at your own peril. You DID watch the video in which he said not having/using a GHD was "madness", right?

Yet another task specific WOD in which we are given a discrete amount of work and tasked to do it as fast as possible. Eventually I'll get a time-specific WOD to talk about. Or not. 5 rounds of the triplet 25 GHD sit-ups, 25 Back extensions, and a legless 15 ft. rope climb.

OK, here we go again with the GHD. I love you all. Really...I do. You're like my little personal flock of fuzzy little newblings, waddling behind me into the pond. Once again I'm going all Papa duck on you and saying NO to the GHD. Come on, you've never used one before. You're gonna do 125 of them?! Uh uh. 5 rounds of Abmat sit-ups for you. Back Extensions can be done on a GHD, a roman chair, or over a big old fluffy exercise ball. They can be scaled all the way to superman, too. Remember that a real back extension is done rather slowly and deliberately. Feel free to sub a hip extension with your lumbar spine/lordotic curve held straight. Go ahead and do 25 per round.

Ah, rope climbs. The bane of the solo, garage gym CrossFitter. Who had a garage with a ceiling high enough to hang rings, let alone a 15' rope? Merde. The WOD is asking for not only a rope climb, not only 5 rope climbs per round, but a f*&^%$g LEGLESS rope climb. Like I said...merde. As Rx'd is to sit on the ground, grab the rope, and haul yourself up all 15' using only your arms. Yah. About that. Can you climb a rope at all? Or does the rope make you want to run to your therapist's couch to review high school gym class trauma?

What shall we do, then? Well, if you are new to CrossFit but you are a gym class rope climbing savant, well, go ahead an do 'em! Most of us can't do these legless. If you can climb a rope using our legs, oh, and you have rope to climb, scaling this to using your legs is cool. Maybe even scale to 2 or 3 per round if you have to rest and recover after each one. Still cool. What if you don't have a rope, or there's a rope in your gym just hanging there, mocking you, because there's not a snowball's chance in American Graffiti that you're ever getting up it? The sub is towel pull-ups; I like jumping towel pull-ups (gym towel draped over a bar) because it is closer to what we do when mortals climb a rope. Newbies should do 5 jumping towel PU per rope climb.

Real, live, honest-to-goodness beginners should do 3 rounds, not 5. Folks with some fitness experience but not CrossFit experience should scale the movements but can go ahead and do all 5 rounds.

Coach is quite sure your core needs some attention, so meddling with your midline in 3-2-1...Go.

Rylen, welcome back! As you probably know, the rough rule of thumb is that the women's rx weight is about 70% of the men's, which would be about 195# here.

My DL 5RM is 280#; I intend to use 195 or 205# tomorrow, if that helps. But if you're really new back, and haven't been doing high reps of compound lifts, I'd find a pretty easy weight until your body catches up with CF again.
@Jim Rx thank you for the help!
Monday, Monday, so good...oh...you're here...OK then.

Day three of the cycle and we get another task-specific WOD, one that is a little bit classic CrossFit and one that is consistent with the theme of the cycle. 275# Deadlifts (195 for women as Rx'd) and strict ring dips in the classic 21-15-9 rep scheme. Start your stopwatch. Do 21 Deadlifts and 21 strict ring dips, back to the bar for another 15 deadlifts followed by 15 strict ring dips, and finally 9 deadlifts and 9 strict ring dips. Hit Stop.

Feel free to flop and writhe.

The Deadlift as noted on the CrossFit Total day is as simple as it can be. Pick up the loaded barbell and then put it down. For WODs such as this one would typically use a traditional DL stance: hands just outside knees rather than sumo. Either a double-overhand or alternate overhand/underhand grip. Scale the weight if necessary. A WOD like this would not typically require a belt. My bias on gloves is that it's up to you. If I get an injury to my hands my family doesn't eat. No straps however; if you can't hold it you can't lift it.

Ring dips are exactly what they sound like, a dip on gymnastic rings. The addition of the qualifier "strict" makes a difference, though. We would usually have the option of kipping in order to go as fast as possible, but today Coach is calling for straight up and down with no assistance from your hips. No rings? No problem. Sub bar dips if necessary, still strict. If bar dips are too much go ahead and do them on a bench or chair, or even from a sitting position using parallettes. Again as strict as possible. FWIW, I can't imagine how you'd kip a deadlift, but if for some reason you've figured that out and want to try, let's assume that the deadlift is strict today, too.

This is gonna be hard and quick (nope...not gonna go there). Experienced CrossFitters are gonna be 4:00 or less. Seriously, this is a sprint for the acclimatized. When trying to decide what weight you should use if you need to scale keep this in mind. This is not a long, slow, heavy grind, and you should use a weight that you can do with minimal breaks. In today's CrossFit 275 is pretty much the new 225. And yes, if you are new to CrossFit and CrossFit.com is going to be your primary fitness program, today's WOD (+ your CrossFit W/U) is all you do today.

Snowy days and Mondays. Pick 'em up and put 'em down in 3-2-1...Go.

Probably paced this too much - had some left in the tank at the end - but wanted to make sure strict ring dips didn't go away. Broke deads 12-9 / 9-6 / 6-3 and ring dips into 3 sets each round. Rep scheme was probably good, just took too long of breaks in between.

Welp...first try at the Newbie Chronicles eaten by gremlins. Sigh...

Finishing up a cycle with some classic CrossFit cardio. 3 rounds for time of ratchet up your heart rate, fry your core, and climb the heart rate ladder juuuust a bit more. Let's take a look.

Row 250M. Once again we're talking about the C2 erg, damper set on 4 or 5. This should be about 1:00 of work or less. The sub is 25 Sumo Deadlift High Pulls with a 45# bar, 35# for women. Don't drop an empty bar, it doesn't like it.

Another lesson in the 3 essential back exercises, today the hip extension. Set your back, maintain your lordotic curve, and crank our 21 hip extension on a GHD, Roman Chair, exercise ball or whatever you MacGyver. Follow with 21 AbMat sit-ups. Butterfly legs or bent knees, anchored or not, the only person who cares is you.

Finish yourself off with a 400M run. Run, not jog. 400M on a track, a MapMy run street course, or a treadmill (2% incline). Hop right back on the rower and go again. After 3 rounds stop your watch (you DID start it in the beginning, right?)

There you have it. Our special kind of aerobic day. Tomorrow is Rest Day so feel free to go for it today. For all of you true Newbies here is a chance to do a WOD as Rx'd in 3-2-1...Go.

And here we are, January 31st. You made it! Congratulations to all of the true newcomers to CrossFit, maybe to fitness in general, who joined us here on CrossFit.com this month. All of us grizzled vets, and for that matter the non-grizzled as well, are delighted that you came along for the ride. We all truly hope you will make this your health habit going forward.

You get to end your month with a CrossFit Hero WOD. This is a signature part of being a CrossFitter. We honor men and women who have given their lives in defense of their fellow citizens in the line of duty. Most of our Heroes were at the sharp end of the spear, many special operators of one kind or another. What they all had in common was some connection to CrossFit or a CrossFitter. Even more than that, this is a new ‚ÄúHero‚Äù, the first time this WOD has ever been posted. That makes this one all the more important because it‚Äôs the first time we get to tell 2Lt. Sisson‚Äôs family how sorry we are for their loss and how thankful we are that men and women like their son step forward on our collective behalf.

Indeed, as I‚Äôve said many times before, this and every Hero WOD is an opportunity for us to also thank the living heroes among us, and for that matter to thank the families who wait at home for their return from duty. It‚Äôs not hard to do. It‚Äôs winter in the northern hemisphere, and maybe you just keep on shoveling until the walk is clear in front of your neighbor‚Äôs house. The one who is deployed in wherever. You‚Äôve made chili for the Super Bowl and on the way to your party you stop off and give a couple quarts to the Dad whose wife pulled the overnight shift at the local PD, and he‚Äôs got the kids. You get the idea. These are gracious people and they will understand what it is you are doing. They will understand and they will thank you right back.

The WOD itself is pretty straightforward. After a month of task-demand workouts we end with another time demand WOD, specifically what is known as an ‚ÄúAMRAP‚Äù. We are given a task and then asked to do as much of this task, as much work as possible in a fixed amount of time. Today we will work for a total of 20:00 and repeat a very simple triplet: 1 15‚Äô rope climb/5 Burpees/Run 200M.

A rope climb without any other qualifier means that you may climb it any way you wish. Since you are trying to do as much work as possible you would use whatever means you need to get up that rope. The first time someone successfully climbs 15 feet above terra firma is another one of those signature CrossFit moments. If there‚Äôs a rope available to you, do give it a try. The sub is towel PU. Drape a towel over a bar, grip the hanging ends (almost typed ‚Äòchads‚Äô LOL) and do a PU. To mimic a rope climb in which you used your legs you could do jumping towel PU, too, just don‚Äôt let yourself down slowly. You‚Äôll likely do a bunch and the negative, or eccentric movement is a prescription for pain. It used to be 1 TPU/1 ft. of rope climb in the FAQ but there is no numerical guidance any longer. Newbies should do 5/Climb.

Have we done burpees yet this month? I hate burpees. No matter when we last did them it was too soon. This is not your drill sergeant‚Äôs burpee where you count out each part of the movement. Nope, this is a get on the ground as fast as possible so that you can get up even faster. From a standing start get yourself to the deck however you wish‚Äîthe fastest way is to just flop onto your chest‚Äîso that your chest and thighs are simultaneously in contact with Gaia. Now get yourself up, hips fully open, jump and clap your hands over your head. You don‚Äôt need much of a jump mind you. Just enough to slip the queen of hearts under your sneaks (the queen of hearts is always your best friend, after all). 5 per round. No scaling. No subs.

The last movement in the triplet is a 200M run. On a track, the street, or a treadmill‚Ä¶whatever you‚Äôve got. This should be fast. Heck, all of this should be fast. Sisson is that rare ‚ÄúHero‚Äù WOD that many will be able to do ‚ÄúAs Rx‚Äôd‚Äù. Like any other ‚ÄúHero‚Äù, we are asked to go just a little further, to work just a little harder than a regular WOD. It‚Äôs the end of the cycle and you get to rest tomorrow. You‚Äôve done a great job this month. Celebrate by honoring Sisson with a major effort.

That‚Äôs it for me. Another January of Newbie Chronicles come and gone. If you are new to CrossFit I hope they were somewhat helpful, and if you are a vet I hope they weren‚Äôt too annoying. I‚Äôll be hanging around, checking in, making sure all of my flock is OK. There are lots of very nice folks here who are willing to lend a hand. Remember that goodwill and courtesy is answered in kind. Welcome aboard. Fasten your seatbelt.

For at least one more year, to the Batcave Robin, our job here is done‚Ä¶

Pretty fun. First time climbing rope with a vest - not too bad, but definitely felt the weight gripping the rope. Wet and muddy out there, so had to towel off the shoes before each rope climb. Nearly had the 10th rope climb; I reached out at the buzzer but my wrap slipped and I came up 6" short. Oh well.

Congrats on going Rx'd, but my workout was more intense than yours.
David, typically comments intended to be humorous are followed with a ‚ÄúLOL,‚Äù or ‚ÄúJ/K,‚Äù or ‚ÄúHA-HA.‚Äù Otherwise, everyone will think you are being serious! But I know you meant it to be funny, because anyone who has been around CF for longer than half a minute knows that each person has an individual journey to follow. Competition and encouragement are expected ‚Äì not negativity. Unless you are the Fittest Man or Woman on Earth, there is always someone bigger, stronger, and faster. The rest of us just fall in line and try to help those around us.

A year and a half ago, when I started CF, there is no way I would have completed today‚Äôs WOD Rx‚Äôd ‚Äì in fact, I could not even do one overhead squat with an empty bar. It‚Äôs all good.

Congrats to everyone who attempted this WOD (scaled or Rx‚Äôd)!

10 Rounds Scaled. Might try Rx on Sunday
Scaling question for the non-authoritative masses...... If someone is doing scaled division and hoists bar overhead for lunges (vice front rack) is it still RXd for scaled? This is due to elbow and wrist issues.
Anything short of full RX is not RX. If you can't do RX do Scaled so you have a benchmark. I don't have Chest to Bar so I did scaled the first time out.
As long as you go from the floor to locked out overhead before you begin your lunges it is RX... at 95lbs of course. You may use any technique you like to get it over head.

Did after Smolov Intense Week 3 Day 2.

An ass-kicker. Tried the step-through style for burpees - I do think it helps, but bar-facing burpees still suck. Pull-ups went really well today. Started breaking them in round 3, but always able to get 5 or 6. Had to really push to finish round 8.

This one was tough. 20 min AMRAP is crazy, tough to pace this one. I think I came out too slow, I didn't want to burn out early. I still didn't have much for a kick at the end though. I might hit this one again Monday not so much to move up just to see if I can do better.

Nice! took me every last second to finish the scaled workout. Hoping to do Rx next year!
79 Rx. At least the website works, too bad I can't submit score via app. Guess I'll wait 2 days until it works...
If you're concerned with your leaderboard standing, keep in mind that an athlete with 1 rep Rx'd will be ranked above athletes who complete all 430 reps scaled
If you do not feel you will make regionals, scaling is not a bad thing. Its all about doing what is best to give you the best workout and to do that in your own comfort zone.. There is zero shame in scaling. And I definitely disagree with the way RX trumps scaled regardless of numbers.
The Open isn't about getting you the best workout, it's a competition for the highest rank. The scaled division exists to increase overall participation, while still rewarding those athletes who can perform the basic movements as prescribed. Many will do the WOD as Rx'd to get a score, rest a few minutes, then smash the scaled version for intensity.

In The Open's ranking system, the only reason to perform the scaled version is when your score would be ZERO reps Rx'd.
Super Kudos to the athletes that can do it RX'd!! I am nowhere near being strong enough to compete in the opens, but I'n just following along with the WODS no matter what, because I really like crossfit, and want to get there eventually! Perhaps I shouldn't post my scores until I'm a little more able bodied.

First time ever really doing TTB, or at least stringing some together. Double unders usually are pretty easy for me, but found myself getting caught up quite a few times!

Really wanted to get to the round of 225, but just ran out of time. T2B went okay - 15/10, then 10-6-5-4. Had hoped for a better performance there. First round of DUs were great; had a few misses in 2nd. Maybe needed to hit the squat cleans at 135 a little faster to get a time cushion.

Sunday musings...

1) Crenellate. Create multiple indentations on an otherwise smooth edge.

No reason. Just a cool word.

2) Eyelash. The normal lifespan of a normal eyelash is approximately 5 months.

Nope. I didn't know that, either.

3) 16.6. Recovering from surgery from a non-CrossFit condition, I sorta kinda did a couple of the 2016 Open WODs. At some point over the rest of the year I will eventually do them (hopefully Master's Rx), but for now I'm about to embark on CrossFit Open 16.6: constantly varied functional movements performed at relatively high intensity, with the intension of improving my work capacity across broad time and modal domains.

The CrossFit Games Open 2016 is an interesting and fun diversion, one that gives us a common experience across time zones and geographic variance. For me, though, the real magic happens in the other 47 weeks, the 47 week experience that you could call "16.6" and heading into "17.0".

That's why I'm here.

4) Easter. Does it strike anyone else as odd, or something like odd, that it is only the two major Christian holidays (Christmas and Easter) that have superimposed, widely followed non-religious traditions? Try as I might I find no such superimposition on such equally important annual religious observations like, say, Ramadan or Yom Kippur . More so, if you do a little digging into the Easter Bunny's origin you find that in his original incarnation he, like Santa Claus, kept a ledger of "good and bad", with the good receiving eggs/candy/gifts. While I have no insight into why this might be, I find it odd.

In the Christian world there is no more important celebration that Easter. Indeed, the very concept of Easter is as difficult and complex as that of the Trinity. Judaism and Christianity share the Old Testament, and presumably therefore share a belief in the same Deity. It is in the interpretation of the Messiah that most people understand the difference between the religions (interestingly, the Koran recognizes J.C. as a significant prophet), but the more profound difference between Christianity and all other religions as far as I can see is the chasm that faith must leap to accept both the Trinity and Easter miracle.

While I am best described as having faith in a deeper, greater Presence, I am not a very religious person any longer (this makes Grambingo very sad). However, not unlike the CrossFit we all practice here, it is instructive to note the secular attempts to nullify the religious aspects of both Easter and Christmas, while noting how hard it is to hold tight the two beliefs that are the crux of Christianity.

Good one, very tough. Did jerks and front squats unbroken, then singles for the power cleans. Probably could have pushed harder through pull-ups, did 20-10-10. Push-ups in sets of 10 mostly. Sit-ups got rough in last 2 rounds.

Fun to do the reverse-order of 16.4. HSPUs took ~5:30, did 10, then sets of 5. Row was 20+ sec faster than last time - 2:59 - felt better too. Wall balls seemed the same, but took longer, 4 min. Deads took the remaining 5+ minutes; did them 10-10-10 and then 5's. Had to use a strap for the right hand on the deads - without, it was putting too much pressure on my stitched-up wound.

It's interesting to row for calories vs. distance. Afterward, I compared my two 55 cal rows. The first (longer) one covered more distance - by about 30-40 meters. It's interesting that distance and calories don't perfectly correlate; not sure why that is.
16:22 Rx. thought reverse order would be a little easier. NOPE

Curious on opinions as there are several people in the comments who scaled Grace and surely could have done this heavier if not Rx. I know the intended stimulus in this is short and fast. So if I know with Rx weight, I'll need over 10 minutes or my form breaks down after 5 reps, scaling is appropriate. But there's some room in between there, meaning going around 3-5 minutes or 5-8 minutes? Any thoughts?

Without bumper plates and/or a gym that allows you to drop weight in between each rep, I have pretty much boiled out as much inefficiency as I can with Grace by having to control the weight down... Need to be better on pacing - the first 10 reps were complete at 32 seconds. It took over 3 minutes to do the last 20 reps... oh well, it was still a fun day!

CrossFit Training posts the RX, beginner, and scaled versions of the WOD on their instagram daily. Here is today's:

Robbie
Complete as many rounds as possible in 25 minutes of:
8 freestanding handstand push-ups
15-foot L-sit rope climb, 1 ascent
Post rounds completed to comments.
Compare to 150124.

BEGINNER
Complete as many rounds as possible in 25 minutes of:
4 push-ups
4 handstand holds, 10 seconds
Rope lie to stand, 4 reps
L-sit hold, 10 seconds
Post rounds completed to comments.

The movements have been changed to ensure the athlete gets exposure while building balance, coordination and strength. During the push-up do a standard plank push-up, keeping the body rigid through out the entire range of motion. For the handstand hold strive to have your body as long as possible, pushing up on the shoulder and squeezing the glutes. See the video for the handstand hold, lie to stands and the L-sit hold. If an L-sit is not yet achievable, a tuck position or alternating a leg while one is tucked are great alternatives.
Intermediate

Complete as many rounds as possible in 25 minutes of:
8 headstand to handstand push-ups or freestanding handstand hold, 4 reps - 10 seconds each
L-sit rope climb attempt, 1 attempt
L-sit pull-up, 4 reps
Post rounds completed to comments.

Scale each movement to a level the athlete can continue to preform while still attempting the more complex version. For the handstand push-ups, scale from a headstand or a handstand hold as in video. This workout will pose a different challenge to different athletes. Work your weakness and the skill presented. In the L-sit rope climb attempts climb as high as possible prior to the l-sit pull-ups.

12 minutes + 10 pull ups RX
"Blue"

Three rounds for time:
Row 500m
21 Burpees
Run 400m

As rx'd, 15:27 (PR).

Course PR by 47 seconds and all-time PR by 21 seconds. This is strange, as I was not trying to PR, and I felt pretty smoked from the strength work beforehand. But if there was a strategy here, it was to relax a bit on the rows so that I was fresher for the rest. Rows were all 1:50-1:55, kept the damper lower than normal (7) and tried to pull a little faster and lighter. Tried to not have too many slow reps during burpees. Focused on breathing during the runs. All rounds were about the same ~ 5:10. Middle one likely the slowest.

rxd 17 rounds plus 15 reps
Started with 3x3 clap pull ups and 3x6 weighted pull ups with 35#, then 12min. Rx'd and 9 reps in minute 13.
Distance Learning From Home:

Do NOT have pull-ups over any kind nor did I have access to a standard pull-up bar at the time of doing this WOD. I did. however, have a "Globo-brand" door mounted rig available. Therefore, I executed this workout by utilizing the standards of 16.1, performing the WOD using "Scaled" movement of "Chin Over the Bar Pull-ups".

My Score: NotRX'd 9 rounds unbroken, + 2 then 4 on round 10.

Note to self: First workout back after spending the week reintroducing myself back after a long, long layoff. While I presently can't afford a gym membership of any kind (nor the commitment) there is no damn reason why I can't Distance Learn. And by posting on the Main site, At least, I will feel that there is an accountability with my self by putting myself out there. Moving ahead my motto is: A little bit of something everyday ‚Äì Smartly. Done. Well..

Therefore, I warmed up using movements which reflected the functionality of the WOD. I have problems with my knees and shoulders so it was critical for the warm up to mirror the physiological pathways as closely as possible, since the work load would shift from a pull-centrict work effort to a total body control effort. Three-points of focus were: 1) Ensure starting from a full extension at the hang

As rx'd, 19 rounds + 17 (PR).

Haven't done this with regular pull-ups for several years now. Unbroken through round 14, then tried to get 10 before breaking. Hot spots and blood blisters forced me to go to mostly singles in the last couple minutes, but I managed to PR by 5 reps and with no open hand tears. Probably could have made a run at 20+ rounds if the hands had held out longer.

So far, 12 times posted today and possibly one person did this as rx'd. The triple under movement is a real discriminator. It would be interesting to see it at the games. The community would talk about it for months.... Can Rich F. even do them, etc. and the next year, everyone would being doing triple unders. Crossfitters would ask "Do you have your Muscle Up?, How about your Triple Unders?" Cool!

I PR'd Lynne before doing this WOD. My new workout partner at the globo-gym wants to be s a "physique" competitor, so.....

Yup, it was body weight for me. Pick it up, drop it, pick it back up. Be like Dory, "just keep swimming, just keep swimming." Ten more reps would have been body weight "Grace", maybe I should have done the extra 10 just to see what it would have been.

Burpees were burpees and toes-to-bar degraded as they are wont to. 5 yo and 8 yo joined me today. 5 yo did "air" HSC, burpees, and knee-to-chest on rings. 8 yo did 5# HSC, burpees, and knee-to-chest on bar. They both stuck with it the full 12 minutes, though I did see 5 yo lying down at one point...8 yo told him he could rest, but he couldn't lie down! Fantastic.

As rx'd, 8 rounds + 1 OHS (PR).

Didn't realize I had done this one before, back in 2013. Got 1 full round more today - but it hurt getting there. This one is sneaky, doesn't look bad on paper, but the OHS really add up and make pull-ups and ring dips so much harder. Went unbroken OHS, except for 1 round where I got mentally weak. Much easier not to have to pick the bar up twice though. Unbroken C2B. Broke ring dips into 2 sets, starting in round 2. Thought I might have 9 rounds in me, but was crashing a bit in the last 7 minutes or so. My original description of this holds: "an all-grown-up version of Cindy".

First time I did this (below), I must have been completely asleep. Not only did I do the wrong number of calories, I did a second round of 75 thrusters instead of the 75 wall balls. What a brain cramp.

Today, I re-did Hildy correctly. It was definitely harder. Not just the extra rowing, but the wall balls were so much worse than the thrusters. First row at 1:59 pace. Thrusters 25-25-15-10. Pull-ups 15-15-10-10 - definitely the most enjoyable part. Wall balls 15-15-15-10-10-10. I was hating life during these. Completely smoked getting back on the rower with a super-slow 2:08 pace. Down for the count after this.

Unbroken deads (185). Last time I did this, it was the back yard course of 100 yards. This time I did 100 meters on the street. The flatness of the course more than made up for the extra few yards. The biggest challenge in this WOD is to be able to pick up the bar quickly each round and then not let go. In later rounds I would rest briefly after 7 reps, but held on to the bar. Colin joined me for the sprints today.

Happy Memorial Day!

Scaled to strict handstand push-ups. Bar muscle-ups as rx'd. Time - 21:04.

Muscle-ups mostly in sets of 2 with a few singles. I figured out how to string them together, but was concerned they might go away if I pushed it. Blisters formed in the round of 15 and opened in the round of 9. I nearly had sub-20, but had a few failed reps near the end with the hand rips. Did HSPUs 15-6 / 10-5 / 9. Really fun WOD.

As rx'd, 6:30 (PR).

Did these 15-6 / 10-5 / 9 for both movements. OHS actually felt pretty good today. Split the deads up to try to stay fresher. Time includes a bit of re-taping 2 minutes in; after 15 OHS in round 1, I looked down and saw blood dripping down my hand. I had forgotten to tape up a small cut (from dinner prep the night before), and it reopened from the pressure of holding the bar overhead.

13:30 dl rx'd, oh 85. I just started doing ohs's tough lift to manage, but I will get bettter...
deadlifts went fairly well, but overhead squats are super hard for me so I did squat therapy instead, and then added a little concept 2 rowing and a few pull-ups just for fun, did all this in a regular gym, not my crossfit box.
btw not even close to rx on anything, very much scaled.

I used 75# for the OHS and 135# for the deadlifts.
It's hard to do things as RX when you only manage 1 or 2 wods a week... it always seems like I haven't done the prescribed movement for ages... so I need to scale (that and I such at OHS)

As Rx. I did this after reading it on this past Friday. I haven't done Pure Mary in a while and said why not try the new version. Always good to see a new stimulus. I think this was a bit harder and quite a lot less reps than a normal Mary would be. I got 290, but if I gamed it more, I'm pretty sure I could have gotten a bunch more. I'm thinking if I did this again I'd get around 320 since the HSPUs were somehow the easiest for me, as the reps were not too crazy really. The pistols added up and just go slow and steady and bang them out. The reps on the pullups actually probably took me the most time as I was breaking them into typically sets of around 15 reps. I didn't want to get burned out but wanted to keep moving and chomping away at the bigger sets. No big deal to do 60 pullups, but wen you have another set in a few minutes you better stay within yourself... or at least that's how I did it. I should have gone out a bit faster for sure. Very little warm ups also before the WOD. I would say I typically get somewhere around 14-15 rounds or Mary if not better, so this total is a big slump in total output for sure. I used to do Cindy, but after getting 31 rounds, it was more of a game about how to increase efficiency of movements and going from one movement to another. I do think both are great workouts, but when the totals get that high, I get pretty sore the next day... much more so than with medium weight medium rep WODs, or higher weight, lower rep WODs. I thin Mary is a real mental tester to keep getting up there to try to get the 15 unbroken every time. I try to go about 10-12 rounds unbroken and then break them up into 9+6 or something similar to keep moving. Fun experiment. I might try it again down the line.

First pistols for me in a long time. Hip hurt a little during them, but improved as it went along, so that is a positive. Shoulder was 95% during HSPUs - no pain on most reps.

Going all the way back to the 80's there has been a strong correlation between elevated cholesterol (and in time more specifically with certain types of LDL) and cardiac deaths. Early studies showed a decrease in cardiac deaths when you lowered CHOL. As Coach often points out, correlation does not equal causation. However, there may be a "co-rider" effect, and effect of statins on a true, as yet undiscovered cause of cardiac disease. The vast majority of doctors get precisely $0 from pharma companies, and not a single doctor gets a single buck for writing an Rx (against the law). Are statins over-prescribed? Man, I sure think so, but don't forget that I'm not a heart doc so I'm actually more like everyone else here than a heart doc. Suffice it to say that my personal response to my own heart risk (Dad had bypass at age 54, grandfather checked out from his third MI at age 68) is diet, CF, and a boatload of fish oil! --bingo
Hey Lowell. A substantial proportion of Rx's of all kinds are for so-called "off-label" indications or usage of a particular drug. Without this we would be able to treat a vastly lower amount of disease. Aspirin for example is only approved for the treatment of pain associated with arthritis if memory serves, but it is a critical drug used in the setting of an acute heart attack. As an eye doc I would struggle to find any fault with any drug that reduced vision loss from non-bleeding macular degeneration (the type being studied). Finding new uses for drugs is crucial for the advancement of medical care. Heck, Viagra was originally designed as an anti-hypertension drug, and who would want to live in a world without Viagra?! Cheers. --bingo

Probably not the greatest day to do this outside. Heat index of 112. In rounds 1 and 2, the farmers carries were the worst; but by the last couple rounds, the weighted lunges were equally bad. Did the lunges with weight at my sides for rounds 1 and 2; in front rack for rounds 3 and 4 (trying to save grip). This might have been the worst WOD ever. I suck at weighted carries, and with the heat, even when I had set the weight down, it did not really feel like I was resting.

This Hero WOD looked daunting when it popped up on main site this summer. At the time, my hip and shoulder were not well enough to attempt. As I looked more closely at it, I realized the gating factor for this was probably my bench press. It was going to take several rounds to accumulate 100 thrusters, and I was likely to burn out on bench before completing. So when the shoulder felt 95%, I went on a 4-week bench cycle (started late October) to try to get stronger at that lift.

Anyway, decided to give this a run today. Paced both bench and pull-ups to avoid burnout. Did bench 4-3-3 until round 7, where I had to start incorporating doubles. Pull-ups consistent at 5-3-2. Thruster sets went 13/15/15/12/13/12/10/10. The early ones were not truly a "max set", as I worried about going too far down into the pain cave (sometimes, it's hard to get out). By the end, though, they were pretty much max sets; I was not convinced I would get all 10 reps that last round.

Always hard to compare how hard Hero WODs are, but this one has to be right up there. Body was completely beat down after this.

Happy Hero Friday! (171 of 173)

That was a full-on beat down. One of those WODs where you're not sure you can finish. Unbroken step-ups, alternating legs every 10. Mentally, these were the hardest...just so many of them. Did power cleans usually 5-5-5; singles for power snatches.

I'm fairly new to crossfit and this is the first time I've really tried to go heavy. I've been staying around 95-115 (lbs) for most of the workouts because I don't want to injure myself. I shocked myself completing all 5 reps at 205 lbs. I'm going to need to buy more weights! How do I know when it's safe to increase the weight? Should I just always push myself to add more?

Shoulder felt well enough to attempt the HSPUs - they went okay. Paced the push-ups in sets of 8 every 20 seconds; the HSPUs in sets of 5 every 30 seconds. HS walk was awful after all the shoulder work - I struggled a ton here. Runs were 3:20 except the last one (3:00); was trying to get in under 29.

As rx'd, 8 rounds + 8 pull-ups (PR).

PR by 1 round. Strict pull-ups went quicker this time, I think. Unbroken for 2 rounds, then usually 5-3. Might have had a bit of a shoulder kip on a few reps near the end. Box jumps as singles, but straight through with no misses. KB swings were tough, but not as bad as expected.

AS Russell say, its Critical that your scale as Crossfit training say you should. Because it will give the right stimulus of the workout. Don't be an RX junky. If the scaling calls for finish under 10 min dont do a 25min workout :)
Hey there, Cole! Congratulations on sticking with Crossfit for a month. I am just starting after a multi-year absence and was extremely humbled today (and disappointed since I came nowhere close to finishing).

Last week was my 10th anniversary doing CrossFit. I decided to do my first ever workout that had to be scaled. Rx was:
5 rounds of:
Sumo dead lift high pulls - 75 lbs, 21 reps
Handstand push-ups, 12 reps

I did 5 rounds of:
Sumo dead lift high pulls - 50 lbs, 21 reps
Seated military presses on a machine at 120 lbs, 12 reps

It took me 25 minutes back then!

Today, 7:55. I'm good with that since I'm 55 and 8 months ago had a total hip replacement. Thanks CrossFit!

As rx'd, 23:26.

Burpee clusters were as awful as expected. I was struggling to string more than a few together by the end. Unbroken pull-ups except round of 18 (12-6). Hands got extra sweaty from the clusters and the pull-up bar was a little damp from the rain we've had. I found myself having to chalk up (which I don't normally do for pull-ups).

Ian joined me again today - he had fun racing ole Dad through this one. He did DB burpee clusters with 5# dumbbells, and jumping pull-ups. Finished in 19:36. He agreed that the burpee clusters sucked.
Could do the back tuck with two spotters, but didn't master it on my own. Did back tucks on a TRX. One hand each ring, flip over backwards.
Have you got a video doing it with a TRX, sound like a good way to learn just can't get my head around stopping my shoulders twisting when keeping hold of the rings/trx (like when you skin the cat your shoulders are kinds inversed)?

Grinder. Runs went okay - better than predicted - first mile run was just under 10 minutes. I elected to do this workout today, as we were forecasted to have heavy rains tomorrow from Hermine. Just my luck, it started to thunder during my first run, and was raining during wall balls and rope climbs (slippery!)...completely soaked by the end - mostly sweat, but some rain as well.

Another rough one. Did farmers carries in the backyard; out and back twice for 200m. Was able to get 100m before resting each round. Weighted pull-ups were going pretty well (most rounds unbroken) until I tore through a blood blister doing the snatches in round 7. That slowed things down and forced more breaks on pull-ups and snatches.

Happy Hero Labor Day! (167 of 169)

Went faster than I thought it would. DUs in 2 big chunks, unbroken T2B, deads 15-10, then just plugged through the box jump overs. On these, I went quick on a rebound jump, but took my time on top of the box to make sure I was organized before jumping down again. Very happy about the toes-to-bar today.

As rx'd. 54 DL (27-17-10) and 45 HSPU (23-15-7) for 99 total reps.

Maybe could have squeezed a few more reps out. And definitely could have gamed it to get more DL reps at the expense of HSPUs. My Diane PR is 4:23; feel I could have beat that given today's numbers.

Son (12 y.o.) did this today with 65# deadlifts and partial ROM push-ups. He forgot to count his reps (rookie mistake). Great work though; this was his first time deadlifting with a barbell. Previously, he had done deadlifts with the kettlebells, and had worked up to the 2 pood one (70#). So this sounded heavy, but his form looked very good, so I let him go for it.

Did not rush through this, as I wasn't sure how long I could continue to pull 405. Unbroken toes-to-bar, went slowly and surely through the burpees, and took my time getting set up for the next deadlift rep. Judgement call on the last dead - my back was smoked and I wasn't sure it was going to go up, but I just couldn't quit in a Hero WOD.

Hmmm. Yuck
Sunday musings‚Ä¶

1) Bamburg. I-95 in the South is a pretty dour trip. Except, that is, for the names of the towns along the way. Like Bamburg. Or Chattahootchie.

Come on. You want to deadlift in Bamburg. You know you do.

2) Radio. ‚ÄúSo what kind of country music do you want to listen to?‚Äù Did you know they bleep out the word ‚Äúhell‚Äù in Georgia?

I-95, headed north.

3) Billboard. Hundreds, maybe thousands of them on 95. A blight on the landscape for sure, but every now and again one might bring a chuckle. Like the one that says simply ‚ÄúWho is Wayne Root?‚Äù

It‚Äôs not exactly ‚ÄúWho is John Galt?‚Äù, but it does make me wonder just a bit what might be going on down here in the Low Country.

4) Tow. We are driving the Hooptie with a horse trailer attached. Headed home from Lovely Daughter‚Äôs house in Bluffton. Getting all kinds of love from the natives as we pass each other on the way. That‚Äôs all kinds of funny to this car guy as I perseverate on my next daily driver. Geography might matter.

I think I just saw a trucker run a Bentley off the road.

5) Ryder Cup. The biennial love-hate gathering of most of the golf world is taking place in Minnesota this weekend. Many of the men in Clan bingo are watching (my brother is there). The Ryder Cup is a fascinating event. Men who are essentially independent contractors for 51 weeks out of the year become teammates for a weekend, and fans choose up sides based on pseudo-national allegiance. Bad behavior in the gallery is de rigueur. The 1990 Ryder Cup at Oak Hill is still my lifetime favorite spectator experience.

What stands out each time is how being part of a team affects the golfers. How their fragile psyche so often crumbles at the point of the trident of team, nation, and fans openly wishing failure upon them. Remember, this is a sport that makes center court at Wimbledon sound like NASCAR. The Ryder Cup exposes each tiny character flaw in the combatants, and that is part of the fascination.

Through our modern miracles of the internet and cell phones I will be able to watch this year‚Äôs final round of 12 singles matches unfold from the comfort of the front seat of the Hooptie.

6) 1st Tee. Why do you do CrossFit? Or if you are reading my treacle on FB, the blog, or LinkedIn, why do you do whatever fitness program you‚Äôve chosen? The simple answer for me is that CrossFit and the fitness it provides me makes most of the things I do in life easier; I‚Äôm better at them because I am fitter, healthier, for following the CrossFit Rx.

There is a secondary benefit for CrossFitters: we have all kinds of community options, places where we feel at home because of our CrossFit. Lovely Daughter and I are once again without a Box to call home, but we can visit CrossFit.com for our fix. Wearing a non-local CF shirt still brings a nod and a smile from the locals if you are visiting.

Watching the Ryder Cup this weekend has reminded me of how much I enjoy the company of golfers. My Dad taught the game to my brother and me when we were in grade school. Some 7 or 8 years ago I trashed my right shoulder doing bench press, which in turn wrecked my golf swing. Unable to stand the thought of playing poorly, and being in pain for the privilege, I haven‚Äôt played since. My story since is that I don‚Äôt miss playing golf, but I do miss the camaraderie of golfers playing and talking about golf.

A funny thing happened yesterday while I was ‚Äúhelping‚Äù to clean out my son-in-law‚Äôs garage. There in the corner were two sets of clubs; I didn‚Äôt even know he played. For the first time in at least 5 years I swung a golf club. It felt OK. Nothing broke. Swinging that club didn‚Äôt bring back memories of shots or holes or rounds from the past. I wasn‚Äôt reminded of how I once played golf but rather of being a golfer. Being with other golfers doing something we enjoy doing, but more so doing it together. With just a few swings I remembered that many of my closest friends play golf and that they have been asking me to join them again on both the 1st tee and the 19th hole for many years now. The thought of maybe playing with my own sons and my son-in-law made me smile.

The activity is less important than the company you keep while doing it. All it took was a couple of swings to remember. Looks like it‚Äôs time to find a new Box and start the next chapter of my life in the CrossFit community. Right after I tee it up again with a brother, a friend, a son, or all three.

I‚Äôll see you next week‚Ä¶

Ended up breaking them 15-10-7-5-5-4-4. Would have been better served to try for 5 sets of 10. Still a fun WOD.

Rows ranged between 12-16 calories. Pulling 16 left me smoked and was not sustainable. After round 7, I realized I was on pace to finish 10 rounds + the Cindy work - meaning I would not have time left to row in the 11th round. So I focused on doing the 20 pulls faster. This saved me 30 seconds or so, which was enough to finish the 11th round of rowing.

I will admit I got disheartened mentally after round 8, I glanced at watch and it said 18:xx and I thought I had been moving faster than that pace. Then looked at watch again and still said 18??? Thought I paused it somehow then saw seconds moving and realized it was the actual time... switched back to stop watch and I was at 15 min so I hurried to salvage my time for the last 2 rounds.

Sunday musings‚Ä¶

1) Legerdemain. Skillful sleight of hand. Somehow worked into seemingly every article every written by the wonderful writer Alexander Wolff of SI.

You will be missed, Sir.

2) Life. ‚ÄúSunrises will always equal sunsets, give or take one.‚Äù Jeff Mallett

What a lovely way to describe life. Bravo.

3) Work. All work that is legal has value. There is honor in work. In purely human terms the value and the honor in doing a job is not related to the income produced, but is rather an inherent property in the work itself. It‚Äôs important to keep this in mind when talk turns to the subject of the economy and jobs.

Watch what happens to someone who for some reason or another is no longer able to do the job that they think of as theirs. Maybe they got hurt, or in some way either physically or mentally just can no longer perform the duties required. Perhaps the job went away; it happens. Without that job, without the satisfaction of doing work and doing it well, they look a bit lost. It‚Äôs almost as if they lack much of a reason to get up in the morning. The same thing happens to people who retire early, regardless of how much they think they want to be retired.

My Dad once employed some 500 folks in the business he owned. Research has shown that the human brain can only maintain a truly personal connection with 150 people at a time, but in some way Dad managed to exceed that with the people who worked for him. I think it‚Äôs because he valued what each one of them did for the company in exactly the same way and to precisely the same degree. Everyone was treated the same, with the same amount of respect and the same sense of their worth. The guy who swept the shop floor knew my Dad in pretty much the same way as the highest producing saleswoman.

Giving someone a job gives him or her the chance to express that honor, to themselves as well as to others. Earning a living has value that is markedly out of proportion to the living you earn. We do ourselves, and all around us, a favor when we reach out to everyone who works for us in any way at any time in a manner that expresses our respect for the honor and the value of their job.

4) Medicine. The ‚Äúexercise is medicine‚Äù movement is kind of a confusing thing. On the one hand we in CrossFit are the uber example of how exercise as an independent variable can enhance health. On the other we have the ‚ÄúBig Sugar‚Äù industry funding research and promoting the notion that exercise is all that you need, that there is no effect of nutrition on health. Train your way out of any kind of diet, if you will. This has led to the toxic effect of ‚ÄúBS‚Äù industry money supporting academic research that is in effect little more than marketing for their products. (Visit TheRussells.CrossFit.com for details).

Here‚Äôs the rub: exercise really is a medicine equivalent for a very large number of medical problems. Heck, if it were only to work for cardiovascular health and Type 2 diabetes it would be, or should be, considered a miracle treatment. Not only that, but exercise very well might work independently of diet. While exercise should not be used as an excuse to consume a poor, dangerous diet, you may actually be able to at least partly out-train a poor diet to at least some degree.

In 2009 a study was published in the International Journal of Epidemiology (http://m.ije.oxfordjournals.org/content/39/1/197.full) examining the effect of aerobic exercise on longevity. Mind you, the study was enrolled prior to the creation of the CrossFit fitness program (completed in 2003), so the definition of fitness (aerobic health) will be viewed as incomplete by any who hang out here. In addition, what is defined as an unhealthy diet would only partially pass muster here; we would agree that simple carbohydrates (sugars) are unhealthy, but no doubt you agree with me that red meat and healthy fat do not render a diet worrisome in the least.

A careful reading of the study revealed a couple of nuggets that will not surprise even the rank rookie CrossFitter. Eating the unhealthiest diet was associated with a 40% increase in mortality in comparison with the healthiest diet. Those who ate that worst diet and reported that they did moderate or greater levels of exercise had a 13.5% decrease in mortality. That group of bad eaters who exercised and were proven on a modified cardiac stress test to actually have greater aerobic fitness levels had a 55% decrease in mortality. Let that sink in for a minute: people who ate a shitty diet who exercised to the degree that they were fit by the testing criteria in the study were half as likely to die in any period than those who were unfit.

Boom.

Frankly, I don‚Äôt care who funded this study. Eating a shitty diet that is high in sugar increases your risk of death by 40%. Proof. Exercise that produces improved fitness, even fitness that we would view as partial, reduces all-cause mortality in people who eat a diet high in sugar by half. Proof. Yeah, sure, I get that this could be used to justify or excuse eating that way, but the reality has always been that most people don‚Äôt exercise at all. Those who do certainly don‚Äôt achieve much in the way of any kind of fitness because they don‚Äôt exercise effectively‚Äîsaying you exercise only got you a 15% decrease in mortality, after all. These results only apply if you get fitness results, and let‚Äôs face it, working hard at exercise is not the default setting in the developed world. By comparison eating better is a breeze.

Studies such as this one are mint, man. Especially to people like us, people who follow the CrossFit Rx. It‚Äôs exercise AND nutrition. Says so in the study. Sure, we can pick at this one if we want, like I did above, but my bid is that we use studies such as this one as talking points to prove that our worldview is the gold standard by which all public health initiatives ought to be compared. We can turn the cynical ‚Äúexercise is medicine‚Äù campaign of ‚ÄúBS‚Äù on its head and use their own data against them. Eat like us (protein, nuts and seeds, little starch, no sugar). Exercise like us (functional movements performed at relatively high intensity). Seek ever-higher levels of fitness (work capacity across broad time and modal domains) like we do.

‚ÄúExercise is medicine‚Äù is just fine as long as we continue to call BS on ‚ÄúBS‚Äù. Health requires both exercise AND nutrition. We are just the right movement to tell that story.

I‚Äôll see you next week‚Ä¶

First set of pull-ups unbroken. First row was just under 3 minutes @ ~1:55 pace. OHS in about 4 minutes. Full break (bar on ground) after 65; took some mini-breaks along the way with bar resting on back. Games standard box jumps (full stand on top); slow and steady, about 2:30. Then back to pull-ups, did them 15-15-10-10. Second row was ~1:52, since I was pulling with everything I had near the end. Fun but tough WOD.

Yaaay! Do I get an award for having the slowest time. Lol. Man I'm looking at everyone else's time and just makes me wonder. What the heck was I doing? I do feel like I did more than 150 maybe 175. I got to a point where I zoned out and wasn't sure if I was on rep 75 or 100. So I went with 75.

David had me preparing for the inverted burpees, but then got crushed by those L pull-ups. That last row was miserable too.
Muscular fatigue won the battle today... lots of rest in there letting muscles slightly recover to bang out the next few reps on just about every exercise. On a positive my rows were unbroken lol!

41:50, subbed 50 cal airdyne for both rowing segments. Everything else was rx'd. L sit pull ups are what really got me.
43:31. Had to scale L pull-ups to regular strict pull-ups. All else Rx. Inverted burpees took forever!

Warmed up and knew I wasn't going to be able to Rx'd. Scaled weight to 135lb for both but MU killed me 15 maxed me out.

So 1 round scaled 135lb in 9 min. Then completed 161130 Rx'd result there.
