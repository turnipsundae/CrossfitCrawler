As rx'd. Took about 20 minutes. Too hard to keep track of the time for each descent. Definitely able to lower much more slowly from pull-up. For HS, did first 10 reps against a wall (trying not to use it), lowered feet first, then to straddle, then down. Did last 10 reps freestanding, and tried to come down in straddle.

Did you rest yesterday? Really? I mean, really rest? I sure hope so. Did you look at what's up there for today's WOD?! That's some heavy sh...shtuff right there.

CrossFit is a strength and conditioning program. If you do CrossFit right out of the box here on the Main Page you will, indeed, get stronger. Will you become as strong as you possibly can, achieve you absolute maximum of maxes? Nah. Of course not. In order to do that you would have to give up all hope of ever having work capacity across broad time and modal domains; you'd just be strong. However, the fact remains that if you do CrossFit you will not only increase your speed, power, and cardiovascular endurance, you will also get stronger. WODs like today's are how we do that.

It's a bit tricky to advise folks on a WOD like this. Are you an experienced power lifter? Have you ever done a deadlift before? How about weightlifting? Do you have experience with the weightlifting exercise the clean? Even if you have some experience with either or both of these exercises it would still be important to have some sense of whether or not you can (or should) be doing a max lift.

Let's start out with this simple, unassailable and incontrovertible fact: if you have never done a deadlift or a clean today is NOT the day to do either a max deadlift or 36 cleans, let alone 36 cleans for time. If this is the case you need to take a big ol' humble pill and make today a learning experience. Find a coach wherever you are working out and ask them to teach you how to deadlift and do a clean. Pay them if necessary. Heck, make them take your money. We do all kinds of deadlifts and cleans. Don't ruin your CrossFit career by blowing a disc out your ass because it says "max deadlift" up there.

Alright, now that we have that out of the way, let's talk about how to approach this if you are a beginner CrossFitter with some lifting experience (or if you are still relatively newish here). The deadlift is the simplest and most useful lift there could be. Pick it up and then put it down. No grunting alarms or concerns about banging your weights, this is CrossFit. Fill an Olympic bar with rubberized weights and then pick it up. In competition (like our upcoming CrossFit Open) you would do a traditional DL with your hands outside your legs. Some, like me, do a sumo stance DL with your legs wide and hands inside (my form is better, and therefore safer). For the WOD no one cares but you. Keep adding weight until gravity wins.

A clean in the simplest terms means picking up a barbell and lifting it until it rests on the front of your shoulders in the "rack" position and standing up. At some point this month I will be able to make really tasteless jokes about "racks" but I'm struggling to find one so I'm gonna let it go today. By convention, if you only see "clean" above that means you are to "catch" the weight in the bottom of a front squat and then stand up to complete the movement. For realsies, if'n you know what yer about, you know that a full "squat clean" will get you a bigger number on a max, but by silent affirmation (at least for Newbies) you should feel free to do a power clean (catch the weight in a quarter squat) if that's more comfortable. Everyone, Newbie or otherwise, should know that "As Rx'd" according to the FAQ is a full (squat) clean.

How's that percentage stack up for you? Man, I look at that and I just cringe. My 1 rep max DL is 315, and my 1 rep max clean is 180. Coach wants me to do 36 cleans, and do them pretty fast, at a weight that's awfully damn close to a lift I've done precisely once. Ever. Here's my bid: be smart. If your numbers are like mine pick a weight that is heavy (that's the requested stimulus), but not so heavy that this is essentially 36 single reps. Aim for 5-7 reps before you have to break. The more inexperienced you are the lower the weight. Do the reps, do them well, and accept a long time, or drastically cut the load and try for a quick time.

You're a Rookster. Be safe. Be smart. Get strong in 3-2-1...Go.
bingo,
Thanks for the clarity on what a rx clean is. Given so many interpretations by mainsite users (some fueled by HQ's videos), I wish HQ would just always specify squat versus power cleans.
Deadlift: 315 overhand (went until I just started to feel discomfort in my lower back....injury).

Hey, that was some heavy stuff yesterday, huh? Pretty cool WOD. If my memory serves, that might be the first WOD here on CrossFit.com where we test a weight and then derive our WOD weight from the individual test. That’s one of the very cool things about this particular version of CrossFit programming: Coach really takes that constantly varied thing to heart. In an interview I described my pre-CF fitness life as “bored and lonely” in the gym. Well, having the cybergym of CrossFit.com cured the lonely part, and believe me, I’ve never been bored doing CrossFit.

Speaking of variance, it looks like we are apparently in a cycle in which we have a concentration on our midline stabilization. Not only that, but we are learning that we can do this without repeating WODs, even if we do repeat exercises. Variance in format, scheme, and volume gives enough of a difference that we will likely forget that we did a row, sit-ups, and back extensions last cycle!

Once again, a task demand WOD in which we are given a finite amount of work and asked to do it as fast as we can. 3 Rounds of the triplet Row 500M/25 GHD Sit-ups/25 Hip Extensions. Did I mention that this is for time? Just before you make that first pull on your C2 hit “start” on a stopwatch…nah, let’s get real, hit start on the fancy stopwatch app on your iPhone…do 3 rounds and then hit stop. Flop. Create sweat angel. Take a pic. Who knows, maybe some day Dave Castro will follow someone on Instagram and maybe it will be you, and he will post your sweat angel picture.

Pshaw, don’t be silly. The Dave Castro is as close as you can get to Chuck Norris—Instagram follows The Dave Castro.

Row 500M. Just like the other day, take your seat on a C2, put the damper on 4 or 5, and pull like a motherplucker. Hop off and go over to the GHD…just kidding…you’re still a Newbie. You have no business whatsoever doing your sit-ups on a GHD. Sit your ass on the ground, let your coccyx get intimate with an Abmat, and do your sit-ups on the ground. 25/round. Do ‘em all. Yer goin’ Almost As Rx’d today, baby! Hop up and get on that GHD (or Roman Chair, or exercise ball) and pump out 25 Hip Extensions (lower back straight with hips anchored). 3 times through and then hit “Stop” on that stopwatch.

YES! Ye-heh-heh-hee-es! You are on day 6 of CrossFit and you did a WOD Almost As Rx’d! Run around the gym and high five everything with a pulse. Seriously, it’s that big a deal. Everyone. Even the lady at the desk who looks remarkably similar to the secretary in the original version of The Longest Yard. Her too. Almost Rx’d baby! Ask her if she grows spiders in there, just like Burt.

‘Cause that’s just how we roll here. Row, Row, Row your core v2.0 in 3-2-1…Go.

Using fitbit as my timer. can't calculate rounds on the timer but first round fastest, and 2nd and third round felt about the same.

Also, for the record, the Charge HR is terrible in capturing Heartrate during CrossFit WODs.
